**Chicago Data Analysis with SQLite & Python**

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a graded assignment focused on exploring, processing, and analyzing three real-world datasets from the City of Chicago Data Portal. Using Python, Pandas, and SQLite, we load, clean, and query the datasets to extract insights related to socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime statistics.

ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries
Python (Data processing & analysis)

Pandas (Data manipulation)

SQLite (Database storage & querying)

IPython-SQL (SQL execution in Jupyter Notebooks)

PrettyTable (Tabular display formatting)

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
Model and load hierarchical and tabular data into an SQLite database.

Write and execute SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

Integrate Python and SQL for efficient data analysis workflows.

Perform filtering, aggregation, sorting, and subqueries for data exploration.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Analysis
Identified high-poverty areas in Chicago using socioeconomic data.

Analyzed public school performance metrics in relation to community conditions.

Categorized and quantified crime incidents to assess safety across neighborhoods.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone this repository and open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Install required dependencies
Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the database setup and analysis.
