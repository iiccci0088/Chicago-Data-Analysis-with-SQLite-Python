📌 Overview
This project is a graded assignment focused on exploring, processing, and analyzing three real-world datasets from the City of Chicago Data Portal. Using Python, Pandas, and SQLite, we load, clean, and query the datasets to extract insights related to socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime statistics.

📂 Datasets Used
Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
Contains six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index” for each Chicago community area (2008–2012).

Chicago Public Schools
School-level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011–2012 school year.

Chicago Crime Data
Reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2001 to present (excluding the most recent seven days).

Note: The datasets used here are subsets with modified column names for easier integration into a relational database.

🛠 Technologies & Libraries
Python (Data processing & analysis)

Pandas (Data manipulation)

SQLite (Database storage & querying)

IPython-SQL (SQL execution in Jupyter Notebooks)

PrettyTable (Tabular display formatting)

🎯 Learning Objectives
Model and load hierarchical and tabular data into an SQLite database.

Write and execute SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

Integrate Python and SQL for efficient data analysis workflows.

Perform filtering, aggregation, sorting, and subqueries for data exploration.

📊 Key Insights & Analysis
Identified high-poverty areas in Chicago using socioeconomic data.

Analyzed public school performance metrics in relation to community conditions.

Categorized and quantified crime incidents to assess safety across neighborhoods.
